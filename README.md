```
git clone https://github.com/respoke/hack-the-holidays.git
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080/
```

The demo must be run from the http(s):// protocol so it can use WebRTC. Running from the file:// protocol won't use WebRTC and so won't work. Here, Node and Express are used to spin up a quick minimal http server. But any static http server, on any platform, will work as well. Enjoy and Happy Holidays!
